Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
pip
Firebase account
Google Cloud account (for Gemini API)
Setup
Clone the repository:
 bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/biznexus-ai.git
cd biznexus-ai


Create a virtual environment:
 bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

 bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Configuration
BizNexus AI requires several configuration steps for full functionality.
Firebase Setup
Create a Firebase project at firebase.google.com
Enable Authentication (Email/Password) and Firestore in your project
Generate a Service Account key:
Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
Click "Generate New Private Key"
Save the JSON file
Create a .streamlit/secrets.toml file in your project root with your Firebase configuration:
toml
[firebase.config]
apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
authDomain = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseapp.com"
projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
storageBucket = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com"
messagingSenderId = "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
appId = "YOUR_APP_ID"
databaseURL = "https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com"

[firebase.service_account]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
private_key_id = "YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_ID"
private_key = """-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENTS_WITH_NEWLINES
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"""
client_email = "firebase-adminsdk@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
client_x509_cert_url = "YOUR_CLIENT_CERT_URL"

Google Gemini API (for AI Assistant)
Go to Google AI Studio and create an API key
Add the key to your .streamlit/secrets.toml file:
toml
[gemini]
api_key = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"


SMTP Setup (for Alerts)
Add SMTP configuration to your .streamlit/secrets.toml file for email alerts:
toml
[email]
sender_email = "your-email@gmail.com"
smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"
smtp_port = 465
smtp_username = "your-email@gmail.com"
smtp_password = "your-app-password"
use_ssl = true
Note: For Gmail, you'll need to generate an App Password rather than using your account password.
